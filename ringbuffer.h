 * Computes the word-aligned index within a ring buffer for accessing 32-bit values.
 *
 * This macro is used to calculate the index for word-aligned access in a ring buffer
 * that uses byte-based indexing. It ensures efficient word access without performing
 * a costly division operation. The byte-based index is converted into a word-based
 * index by shifting right by 2 (equivalent to dividing by sizeof(uint32_t)).
 * The result is wrapped using the word-based buffer mask to ensure proper wrapping
 * around the buffer size, which must be a power of two.
 *
 * @param rb A pointer to the ring buffer structure.
 * @param index The current byte-based index (e.g., `head_index` or `tail_index`).
 * @return The word-aligned index within the ring buffer for 32-bit access.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The buffer mask for words is derived by dividing the byte-based buffer mask by 4,
 *   since 4 bytes make up one 32-bit word. This ensures proper wrapping for word-based access.
 * - The ring buffer size must be a power of two to enable efficient masking.
 * - This macro assumes `index` is a byte-based offset, such as `head_index` or `tail_index`.
 *
 * Example:
 *   size_t word_index = RING_BUFFER_WORD_INDEX(rb, rb->head_index);
 *   ((uint32_t*)rb->buffer)[word_index] = some_word_value;
